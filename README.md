# NS2 Pricing Tool ðŸ§¾ðŸ’»

This Streamlit-based web application streamlines the process of comparing the SAP Pricing List with the NS2 Availability Matrix and merging CAE Unofficial PAM, NS2 Availability Matrix, and Software Stack data. It's designed to assist NS2 pricing teams in identifying product additions, removals, and updates as well as consolidating disparate datasets into one unified view.
